Dude, just finished Thudarum and my brain is like... brimming with random thoughts, lol. Seriously, what a rollercoaster. It was all intense and then also kinda absurd at times. The main character legit took me on a journey. One moment I'm all yasss” rooting for them, and the next I'm like, bruh, what are you doing?” 😂

And oh man, the fight scenes! I swear, it seemed like they spent half the budget on just smashing stuff. Not that I'm complaining, you know what I mean? 😂 But honestly, some parts were just too much, like, we get it, you're cool, slow down, bro. Though I gotta admit, the soundtrack was kinda sick. Really amps up the drama.

> But, like, these plot twists... I'm still processing half of it. At some point, I was just like, Did someone download the movie and mix up the script or something?! Felt like I was living in parallel universes for a bit there. The emotional swings were real, up and down, all over the place. What even?! 😵

Oh hey, remember we were talking about how long it always takes us to actually watch the movie once we talk about it? Yeah, this one I jumped right into. You’ll get what I mean when you finally check it out. 😆

The ending though. It was... I don’t even know. On one hand, it was kinda expected, like, we've all seen this trope before. But then again, I didn't expect that particular twist. Anyway, I hope you watch it soon so we can unpack the chaos together.

// I have no idea why I’m writing this: for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {} 

So yeah, that's where I'm at emotionally right now, a hot mess. But hey, keeps life interesting. Catch ya later, OK? 🌀
